# Linear Regression 
This project contains a Python implementation of a simple linear regression algorithm. The script is designed to illustrate how linear regression works under the hood, without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

<ins>Features</ins> <br>
LinearRegression Class: Implements the following methods:
* fit(X, y): Trains the model using the training data X and target values y.
* predict(X): Predicts target values for the input data X based on the trained model.
* mse(y, y_pred): Calculates the Mean Squared Error between the actual and predicted values.

# Logistic Regression 
This repository contains a Python implementation of Logistic Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning for binary classification problems.

<ins>Overview</ins> <br>
The LogisticRegression class provides a simple yet effective implementation of the logistic regression algorithm using python. 

<ins>Features</ins> <br>
LogisticRegression Class: Implements the following methods:
* fit(X, y): Trains the model using the training data X and target values y.
* predict(X): Predicts target values for the input data X based on the trained model.
* sigmoid: The sigmoid function transforms any input value into a value between 0 and 1.
